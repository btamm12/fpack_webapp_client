# 3. Working With Praat

## 3.1. What is Praat?
Praat is a speech analysis tool used for doing phonetics by computer. Praat can
analyse, synthesize, and manipulate speech, and create high-quality pictures for
your publications.

Some of Praat’s most prominent features are:
- Speech analysis
- Speech synthesis
- Speech manipulation
- Speech labelling
- Grammar models
- Statistical analysis

## 3.2. Praat Tutorial
I have created a YouTube playlist which explains how to use Praat much better
than I could describe in this text.

If you click the image below, it will take you to that playlist. The total
duration is 20 minutes.
