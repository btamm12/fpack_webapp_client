# 7. Sending Your Results

Since it is not currently possible to directly upload files to the server
(security reasons, see Section 7). You will need to send them directly to me,
and I will upload them using my ESAT account.

## 7.1. File Location

The automatically generated transcripts will appear in the folder
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/03_generated_transcripts/
```
as `.txt` files. You should submit them to me in batches, so I can upload them to the
server and generate new TextGrid files where the timing of the words is calculated
using the transcript.

## 7.2. Submitting The Transcripts

Compress the `.txt` files into a `.zip` file and send it to my email directly
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```
or by sharing a WeTransfer/Google Drive/... link.

## 7.3. After Submission

After sending the files to me, you can move them to the following folder.
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/04_submitted_transcripts/
```
This should keep the process organized and streamlined.
