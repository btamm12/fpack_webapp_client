# 6. Cooperation Between Annotators

You should coordinate with your fellow annotators about who will annotate which data.

Even if you are working alone, **you must still select your sections before the tool
will work!**

## 6.1. Choosing Your Sections

The full list of available data can be found in the `collaboration/all_sections.txt`
file. You should copy the lines that you would like to annotate and paste them in the
`collaboration/my_sections.txt` file.

**For Example:**

If you would like to annotate the participant `s32`, your `my_sections.txt` file
should look like this.

*my_sections.txt*
```
s32_actua_BL
s32_bio_part1_BL
s32_bio_part2_BL
s32_bio_part3_BL
s32_bio_part4_BL
s32_bio_part5_BL
s32_day_BL
s32_object_BL
s32_picture_BL
```
