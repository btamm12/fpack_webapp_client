# 4. Request Subject Mapping

Before this application can do anything, it needs a certain file, called the "subject
mapping". This file provides an extra layer of security to protect the data of the
study participants.

**To get access to this file, you must send me an email.** Please mention "subject
mapping" in the email subject.
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```

When I send you the file `subject_mapping.txt`, you must place it in the root folder
of the repository, i.e.
```
fpack_webapp_client/subject_mapping.txt
```
