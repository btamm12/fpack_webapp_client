# 7. Cooperation Between Annotators

You should coordinate with your fellow annotators about who will annotate which data.

Even if you are working alone, **you must still follow these steps before the tool
will work!**

## 7.1. My Name

Please copy your name from the file `collaboration/all_annotators.txt` and paste it
in the file `collaboration/my_name.txt`.

**For Example:**

*my_name.txt*
```
bastiaan
```
## 7.2. My Sections

The full list of available data can be found in the `collaboration/all_sections.txt`
file. You should copy the lines that you would like to annotate and paste them in the
`collaboration/my_sections.txt` file.

**For Example:**

If you would like to annotate the participant `s32`, your `my_sections.txt` file
should look like this.

*my_sections.txt*
```
s32_actua_BL
s32_bio_part1_BL
s32_bio_part2_BL
s32_bio_part3_BL
s32_bio_part4_BL
s32_bio_part5_BL
s32_day_BL
s32_object_BL
s32_picture_BL
```
