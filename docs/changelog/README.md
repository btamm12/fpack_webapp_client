# Changelog

This folder contains the changelogs of the project, grouped by MAJOR version (see
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)).

## 1. What is a changelog?
A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of
notable changes for each version of a project.

## 2. Why keep a changelog?
To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes
have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

## 3. Who needs a changelog?
People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human
beings who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want
to know why and how.
