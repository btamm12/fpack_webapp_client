# 6. Your Task (Part 2)

Your task as an annotator consists of two parts:
- part 1: annotating
- **part 2: reviewing**

This section covers the second part of your task.

## 6.1. Review Workflow

In order to minimize annotation errors, every transcript will be reviewed by another
annotator. This will also ensure that we are all annotating with the same style.

### 6.1.1. Step 5: Review Me!

As soon as another annotator's transcripts are uploaded to the server, the following
directory will be automatically filled with some of those transcripts.
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/05_review_me/
```
Your job is to proofread the transcript and fix any mistakes.

An `.html` file will also be provided, so you can listen to the full audio file. If
you open this in a browser, it will direct you to the appropriate file.


### 6.1.2. Step 6: Corrected Reviews

*There's no work for you to do.* Just save the corrected review files in the
following folder.
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/06_corrected_reviews/
``` 


### 6.1.3. Step 7: Submitted Reviews

In order to keep the process organized and streamlined, the submitted reviews should
be moved to the following folder.
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/07_submitted_transcripts/
```
