# 1. Overview

## 1.1. Project Description

This annotation process is part of a longitudinal study of elderly subjects over 10
years to study the evolution of Alzheimer's disease and how it relates to speech and
brain characteristics. Some of the participants will be completely healthy, while
others will have a diagnosis of an early-stage neurodegenerative disease. The
language spoken by the participants is Dutch.

Spontaneous speech data is already being collected through interviews. This data must
be accurately transcribed in order to perform further Natural Language Processing
(NLP) analysis.
