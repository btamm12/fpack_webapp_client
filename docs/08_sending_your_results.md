# 8. Sending Your Results

Since it is not currently possible to directly upload files to the server
(security reasons, see [Section 9](09_future_work)). You will need to send them directly to me,
and I will upload them using my ESAT account.

## 8.1. File Location

The automatically generated transcripts will appear in the folder
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/03_generated_transcripts/
```
as `.txt` files. You should submit them to me in batches, so I can upload them to the
server.

The same applies for the corrected reviews, which will be stored in the folder
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/06_corrected_reviews/
```

## 8.2. Submitting The Transcripts/Reviews

Compress the `.txt` and `.html` files into a `.zip` file and send it to my email
directly
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```
or by sharing a WeTransfer/Google Drive/... link.

## 8.3. After Submission

After sending the files to me, you should move them to the appropriate folder to keep the process organized and streamlined.

*Transcripts:*
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/04_submitted_transcripts/
```

*Reviews:*
```
fpack_webapp_client/data/07_submitted_reviews/
```
