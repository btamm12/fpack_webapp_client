# 2. File Types

## 2.1. Introduction

You will be working with two types of files:
1. audio segments
2. TextGrids

## 2.2. Audio Segments
Each interview consists of multiple sections, and each section is recorded as a
separate audio file. To make your life easier, every audio file (duration = 1-15
minutes) will be split into **audio segments** containing roughly 15 seconds of
audio. The name of these files are:
```
sXXX_[type]_BL_XXX.wav
```
where `X` is an arbitrary number and `[type]` is the name of the interview
section, i.e. one of the following:
- `actua`
- `bio_part[1-5]`
- `day`
- `object`
- `picture`

## 2.3. TextGrids
Annotations are stored as **TextGrid** files, which contain the transcription
along with the timing of each word (i.e. when does the word start/stop).

Instead of having you, the annotator, indicate the start/stop times and
transcribe each word manually, we are using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
to speed up the process. The ASR model will generate a `.ctm` file containing
the predicted transcription (and timing) of the audio file. This application
will use the `.ctm` file to generate an initial TextGrid file.

There is one TextGrid file per audio segment, namely:
```
sXXX_[type]_BL_XXX.TextGrid
```
The meaning of `X` and `[type]` is the same as above.
