# Step 6: Corrected Reviews

Once you have proofread a transcript, you can move it into this folder. The
application will not do anything in the background: this is just to keep the process
organized and streamlined.

Once again, you should send the files to me in batches, so I can upload them to the
server.

## 6.1. Submitting The Reviews

Compress the `.txt` and `.html` files into a `.zip` file and send it to my email directly
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```
or by sharing a WeTransfer/Google Drive/... link.

## 6.2. After Submission

After sending the files to me, you can move the `.txt` and `.html` files to the
`07_submitted_reviews/` directory.
