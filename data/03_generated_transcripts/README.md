# Step 3: Automatically Generated Transcripts

The automatically generated transcripts will appear here as `.txt` files. You should
submit them to me in batches, so I can upload them to the server and generate new
TextGrid files where the timing of the words is calculated using the transcript.

## 3.1. Submitting The Transcripts

Compress the `.txt` files into a `.zip` file and send it to my email directly
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```
or by sharing a WeTransfer/Google Drive/... link.

## 3.2. After Submission

After sending the files to me, you can move them to the `04_submitted_transcripts/`
directory. This should keep the process organized and streamlined.

## 3.3. Future Work

In a later version of the tool, it may be possible to do this calculation yourself,
but for now it's easiest if I do it. This is because the ASR model that will perform
the timing calculation is located on the ESAT server and only someone with an ESAT
account can activate the model.
