# Step 3: Automatically Generated Transcripts

The automatically generated transcripts will appear here as `.txt` files. If you
would like to double-check the transcript, I have provided `.html` files which will
direct you to the full audio file.

If you are satisfied with the transcript, you should submit the `.txt` files to me in
batches, so I can upload them to the server.

## 3.1. Submitting The Transcripts

Compress the `.txt` and `.html` files into a `.zip` file and send it to my email
directly
```
bastiaan.tamm@kuleuven.be
```
or by sharing a WeTransfer/Google Drive/... link.

## 3.2. After Submission

After sending the files to me, you can move the `.txt` and `.html` files to the
`04_submitted_transcripts/` directory. This should keep the process organized and
streamlined.
