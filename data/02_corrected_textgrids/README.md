# Step 2: Corrected TextGrids

**There's no work for you to do! Just save the corrected TextGrid files here.**

Any TextGrid files that you save in this folder will be automatically converted into
transcription `.txt` files. After a few seconds, the TextGrid file should disappear
and a `.txt` file will appear in the `03_generated_transcripts/` directory (*assuming
the application is running*).
