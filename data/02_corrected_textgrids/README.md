# Step 2: Corrected TextGrids

**There's no work for you to do! Just save the corrected TextGrid files here.**

After you finish an entire interview section, the TextGrid files that you saved in
this folder will be automatically converted into a transcript `.txt` file. After a
few seconds, the TextGrid files should disappear and a `.txt` file will appear in the
`03_generated_transcripts/` directory (*assuming the application is running*).
