# Difficult To Annotate

Try your best to follow the pipeline. However, it may be the case that a certain
individual is too difficult to annotate accurately (e.g. > 20% of spoken words are
unintelligible and you have marked them with "xxx").

In this case, you can move the .TextGrid file (*and its WAV file*) to this folder, so
you can work on other annotations first.

If you are able to annotate the difficult section at a later point, move the
.TextGrid file (*and its WAV file*) into the folder `02_corrected_textgrids/` as
usual.
