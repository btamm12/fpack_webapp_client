# Step 5: Review Me!

In order to minimize annotation errors, every transcript will be reviewed by another
annotator. This will also ensure that we are all annotating with the same style.

As soon as another annotator's transcripts are uploaded to the server, this directory
will be automatically filled with some of those transcripts. Once again, `.html`
files are provided, so you can listen to the full audio file. Your job is to
proofread the transcript and fix any mistakes. 

When you are finished proofreading, save the file and move both the `.txt` and
`.html` files to the next folder `06_corrected_reviews/`.
