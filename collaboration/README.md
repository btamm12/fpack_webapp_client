# Collaboration

In this folder you will find two files:
1. all_sections.txt
2. my_sections.txt

If the file `my_sections.txt` has not appeared, you probably have not run the
installer completely. See [the installation guide](../install/README.md) for more
details.

## Choosing Your Sections

You should coordinate with your fellow annotators about who will annotate which data.
The full list of available data can be found in the `all_sections.txt` file. You
should copy the lines that you would like to annotate and paste them in the
`my_sections.txt` file.

**For Example:**

If you would like to annotate the participant `s32`, your `my_sections.txt` file
should look like this.

*my_sections.txt*
```
s32_actua_BL
s32_bio_part1_BL
s32_bio_part2_BL
s32_bio_part3_BL
s32_bio_part4_BL
s32_bio_part5_BL
s32_day_BL
s32_object_BL
s32_picture_BL
```
