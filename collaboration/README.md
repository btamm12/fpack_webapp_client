# Collaboration

In this folder you will find four files:
1. `all_annotators.txt`
2. `all_sections.txt`
3. `my_name.txt`
4. `my_sections.txt`

If the files `my_name.txt` and `my_sections.txt` have not appeared, you probably have
not run the installer completely. See [the installation guide](../install/README.md)
for more details.

## 1. My Name

Please copy your name from the file `all_annotators.txt` and paste it in the file
`my_name.txt`.

**For Example:**

*my_name.txt*
```
bastiaan
```
## 2. My Sections

You should coordinate with your fellow annotators about who will annotate which data.
The full list of available data can be found in the `all_sections.txt` file. You
should copy the lines that you would like to annotate and paste them in the
`my_sections.txt` file.

**For Example:**

If you would like to annotate the participant `s32`, your `my_sections.txt` file
should look like this.

*my_sections.txt*
```
s32_actua_BL
s32_bio_part1_BL
s32_bio_part2_BL
s32_bio_part3_BL
s32_bio_part4_BL
s32_bio_part5_BL
s32_day_BL
s32_object_BL
s32_picture_BL
```
